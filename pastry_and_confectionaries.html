<p>Everyone loves food right?
Yep, food is one thing that unites
 everyone and gets the fam talking.
I mean who can resist the arouma of
the famous sunday jollof and 'big'
chicken from your mum's kitchen. Even
if she vexes you, nobody will tell you to
leave that vex and go and eat.
</p>
<p> In addition to preparing our students to
take the world by storm, we also have to prepare
them for another equally important role:
Managing the home. And every standard mummy of
every house should know how to COOK.
So RGA has introduced this elective to equip girls
with the art and mastery of cooking.
</p>
<p>The students in this elective where taught(by our
own Mrs. Ikechukwu) on how to make different snacks like
meatpie,eggroll,yoghurt
and fish roll, just to name a few. </p>
