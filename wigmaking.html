<h1>Wig Making</h1>


<p><img src="wig5.jpg"alt= "wig5"> <img src="wig0.jpg"alt="wig0"></p>
<p>As part of the RGA Elective Program, we have
decided to educate our girls on how to make one
essential things of a woman's daily mission
(aka dressing up) known as WIGS!!
 Wigs, are essential to many women due to their
ability to give one a new look in about five seconds,
 and conceal whatever we want hidden(for reasons best
known to us), right?. For this years edition of the
wig making elective, we have two groups:weavons
and attachment.
</p>

<h2>Weavon</h2>
<p><img src="wig7.jpg"alt="wig]"><img src="weavon10.jpg"alt="weavon10"></p>
<p>Weavons can be classified into human hair
and extensions.This are manufactured head covering
of real or artificial hair
worn in the theatre,as personal adornment, disguise
or symbol of office or for religious reasons.
The wearing of weavons dates from the earliest recorded
times;it is known,for example, that the ancient Egyptians
shaved thier heads and wore wigs to protect themselves
from the sun and that the Assyrians,Phonicians, Greeks
and Romans also used artificial hairpieces at times.
 <p>Weavons can come in different styles,they can
be curly,waves,Fringes,Straight weavons.

  <h3>Attachment</h3>

<p>Attachment extensions are known to come from the black
woman race but studies have found that hair extentions
date back to around 3400 BC in Egypt.The hair weave was
invented in 1951 by an African American woman named
Christina Jerkins.</p>
<p>Attachment wigs come in different styles like:twisting
,braiding etc. Our students specialised mainly on Braiding
.</p>
